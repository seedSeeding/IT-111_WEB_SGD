                <h1>Agricultural production</h1>
                <span> Agricultural production is the process of growing crops and raising livestock for food,
                    fiber, and other resources.</span>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- details -->
        <section class="details" id="details">
            <p><span>Agricultural production</span> Climate-related disasters, including droughts and floods, severely disrupt agricultural production, posing significant challenges to food security worldwide. Prolonged droughts deplete water resources, reduce soil fertility, and hinder crop growth, while floods can destroy farmland, wash away topsoil, and contaminate water supplies. These disasters often lead to reduced crop yields, creating widespread hunger and malnutrition, particularly in regions where communities depend on subsistence farming for their livelihoods.

                As a result, vulnerable populations face heightened risks of poverty and health issues, with children and the elderly being particularly affected by malnutrition. Climate-induced food insecurity also places immense pressure on governments and international organizations to provide emergency aid and resources, further straining global economic systems. In the long term, these challenges can exacerbate social and political instability, driving migration, conflicts over scarce resources, and deepening inequalities between developed and developing nations. Addressing these issues requires a coordinated effort to implement sustainable agricultural practices, improve disaster preparedness, and combat the root causes of climate change.

                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Soil Preparation</h1>
                    <p>Soil preparation involves clearing the land, removing weeds, and loosening the soil to create a fertile environment for plant roots to grow and access nutrients. This process includes plowing, harrowing, and leveling the soil to ensure even distribution of moisture and air. Proper soil preparation is crucial for healthy crop development and increased yields.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Planting</h1>
                    <p>Planting is the process of sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings into the soil. It requires careful planning to determine the correct depth, spacing, and timing based on the type of crop being grown. This step ensures optimal germination and promotes healthy growth, allowing crops to establish strong root systems for better nutrient absorption.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Fertilizing</h1>
                    <p>Fertilizing involves the application of essential nutrients to the soil to support plant growth. This can be done using organic matter, such as compost or manure, or synthetic fertilizers. Proper fertilization ensures crops receive the right balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are critical for healthy leaves, roots, and overall development.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Irrigation</h1>
                    <p>Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crops to maintain adequate moisture levels in the soil. Different irrigation methods, such as drip, sprinkler, and surface irrigation, are used depending on the type of crop and climate. Effective irrigation prevents water stress, enhances crop growth, and increases overall yield.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Harvesting</h1>
                    <p>Harvesting involves collecting mature crops from the field. It is a critical stage where timing is essential to ensure maximum yield and quality. Harvesting can be done manually or using machines, depending on the type of crop. Proper handling and care during harvesting prevent damage to the produce, ensuring it remains fresh and market-ready.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Storage</h1>
                    <p>Storage is the process of preserving harvested crops to prevent spoilage and maintain quality. Proper storage involves controlling temperature, humidity, and ventilation to avoid the growth of mold, pests, and other contaminants. This step ensures that crops remain fresh and available for consumption or sale over an extended period.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Animal Rearing</h1>
                    <p>Animal rearing involves the breeding, feeding, and management of livestock for food, labor, or by-products like wool, milk, and leather. Proper animal husbandry ensures the health and well-being of animals, providing them with suitable housing, veterinary care, and nutrition. This practice is essential for sustainable livestock production and farm profitability.</p>

                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Aquaculture</h1>
                    <p>Aquaculture, or fish farming, is the controlled cultivation of aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants. This method provides a sustainable source of seafood, reduces the strain on wild fish populations, and offers economic benefits. Proper aquaculture management includes water quality control, feeding, and disease prevention.</p>

                <div class="what-col">
                    <h1>Floriculture</h1>
                    <p>Floriculture is the practice of growing and cultivating flowering plants for use in gardens, landscaping, and commercial purposes such as cut flowers and ornamental plants. This field requires knowledge of plant care, pest management, and market trends. Floriculture plays a vital role in the horticulture industry, contributing to aesthetics, well-being, and the economy.</p>
