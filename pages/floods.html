                <h1>Flash Floods</h1>
                <span>  Flash floods are sudden, intense floods caused by heavy rainfall, dam breaks, or rapid
                    snowmelt, often occurring with little warning.</span>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- details -->
        <section class="details" id="details">
            <p><span>Flash Floods</span>  can be caused by a number of things, but is most often due to extremely heavy rainfall from thunderstorms. Flash Floods can occur due to Dam or Levee Breaks, and/or Mudslides (Debris Flow).

                The intensity of the rainfall, the location and distribution of the rainfall, the land use and topography, vegetation types and growth/density, soil type, and soil water-content all determine just how quickly the Flash Flooding may occur, and influence where it may occur.
                
                Urban Areas are also prone to flooding in short time-spans and, sometimes, rainfall (from the same storm) over an urban area will cause flooding faster and more-severe than in the suburbs or countryside. The impervious surfaces in the urban areas do not allow water to infiltrate the ground, and the water runs off to the low spots very quickly.
                
                Flash Flooding occurs so quickly that people are caught off-guard. Their situation may become dangerous if they encounter high, fast-moving water while traveling. If people are at their homes or businesses, the water may rise quickly and trap them, or cause damage to the property without them having a chance to protect the property.

                    <p>Tune in to your local news or radio station for weather updates and official advice. If you are advised to evacuate, grab your emergency kit and ID papers and do so immediately. If first responders have set up barricades, do not try to pass them – they have been set up to safely direct people around dangerous areas.</p>

                    <p>If you have the time and are able to do so safely, unplug appliances and turn off any utilities like electricity, gas and water before evacuating.</p>

                    <h1>Get to high ground</h1>
                    <p>To avoid standing, flowing or rising water, move to higher ground. Never try to walk, swim or drive through fast-moving flood water. If you are in your vehicle and it is filling with water, get onto the roof. If you are trapped in a building, get to the highest level and only go onto the roof if necessary. Do not go into an enclosed space at the highest level of your home, such as a loft or attic, as this could result in being trapped by rising floodwater.</p>
