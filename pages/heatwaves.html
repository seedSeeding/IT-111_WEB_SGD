        <section class="details" id="details">
            <p><span>Heatwaves</span> , or heat and hot weather that can last for several days, can have a significant
                impact on society, including a rise in heat-related deaths. Heatwaves are among the most dangerous of
                natural hazards, but rarely receive adequate attention because their death tolls and destruction are not
                always immediately obvious. A study found that from 2000–2019 approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths
                occurred each year, including more than 70 000 who died during the 2003 heatwave in Europe.

                Population exposure to heat is increasing due to climate change. Globally, extreme temperature events
                are observed to be increasing in their frequency, duration, and magnitude. Between 2000 and 2016, the
                number of people exposed to heatwaves increased by around 125 million.

                While the effects of heat may be exacerbated in cities, due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, the
                livelihoods and well-being of non-urban communities can also be severely disrupted during and after
                periods of unusually hot weather.

                Heatwaves can burden health and emergency services and also increase strain on water, energy and
                transportation resulting in power shortages or even blackouts. Food and livelihood security may also be
                strained if people lose their crops or livestock due to extreme heat.

                    <h1>Stay Hydrated</h1>
                    <p>Hydration is essential for maintaining good health, especially during hot weather. Make it a habit to drink water consistently throughout the day. Aim for at least one cup of water every hour, but don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink. Thirst is a sign that your body is already on its way to dehydration. Carry a reusable water bottle with you to make it easy to stay hydrated on the go. While water is the best choice, you can also drink natural fruit juices or herbal teas. Avoid beverages that dehydrate you, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol, as they can increase water loss from your body.</p>

                    <h1>Stay Cool</h1>
                    <p>Keeping cool is crucial when the weather heats up. Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing made from breathable fabrics like cotton or linen. These materials allow better airflow and help you stay comfortable. A wide-brimmed hat provides additional protection for your face, ears, and neck from direct sunlight. To cool down quickly, you can take a refreshing shower or bath. If that's not possible, try dabbing a damp cloth on areas like your wrists, neck, or forehead. Fans and air conditioning are also useful for maintaining a cool indoor environment. If you're outdoors, seek shaded areas whenever possible to minimize direct sun exposure.</p>

                    <h1>Avoid the Heat</h1>
                    <p>The heat is most intense during the middle of the day, typically from 10 AM to 2 PM. During these peak hours, it’s best to stay indoors or in shaded, cooler areas. If you must go outside, take precautions to protect yourself. Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and lightweight clothing that covers your skin to reduce exposure to the sun’s rays. Don’t forget to apply sunscreen with a high SPF rating to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, even on cloudy days. If possible, plan outdoor activities for early in the morning or later in the afternoon when the sun is less intense. Staying inside a well-ventilated, air-conditioned space can help you avoid heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion or heatstroke.</p>
